The purpose of this repo is to learn iOS Development.
The initial project was provided by The App Brewery, my objective was to learn and implement the things provided by them.



Auto Layout and setting constraints in Xcode is both a complex topic and also involves very little Swift programming. That’s why we’ve left it out for all the apps we have made so far. But now that you’re on your way to becoming a serious app developer, we’re going to cover the key parts of Auto Layout and Constraints so your apps can look good on any device.

Constraints allow us to set rules as to how we want our views to be displayed. Because mobile screens have different resolutions and sizes, we need these rules to tell the iPhone/iPad how it should layout the display. These rules allow our UI elements to be resized and positioned so that no matter which screen they are displayed on, they always look as the designer intended.
